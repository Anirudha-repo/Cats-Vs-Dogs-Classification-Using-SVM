# Cats-Vs-Dogs-Classification-Using-SVM
Implementing a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the dataset.

 The project involves:

- **Data Collection**: Gathering a dataset of cat and dog images from sources like Kaggle or manually collecting images. Ensuring a balanced dataset with an equal number of cat and dog images.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the images for training by resizing them to a uniform size, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the data to increase diversity.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features from the images using techniques like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture essential patterns.
- **Model Training**: Training the SVM model on the extracted features, tuning hyperparameters such as the kernel type and regularization parameter to optimize performance.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Performing cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.
- **Prediction**: Using the trained model to classify new images of cats and dogs, providing a confidence score for each prediction.

This project leverages SVM to create an efficient and accurate classification system for distinguishing between cats and dogs.
